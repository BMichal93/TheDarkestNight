// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — AI/TribesDialogue.cs
// Replaces vanilla lord dialogue for all Tribal lords (Tribes of the East /
// khuzait kingdom) with fanatical, blood-hungry lines befitting riders sworn
// to the God-King's fire. Mirrors the structure of TempleDialogue.cs.
//
// Each lord speaks from a pool of lines selected deterministically by their
// StringId hash. Multiple variants are registered; conditions evaluate at
// conversation time so the same lord always says the same line.
