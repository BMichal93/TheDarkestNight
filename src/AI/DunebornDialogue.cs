// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — AI/DunebornDialogue.cs
// Replaces vanilla lord dialogue for all Duneborn lords (Duneborn / aserai
// kingdom) with distant, calculating lines befitting the desert's scholars
// and quiet debt-collectors. Mirrors the structure of TempleDialogue.cs.
//
// Each lord speaks from a pool of lines selected deterministically by their
// StringId hash. Multiple variants are registered; conditions evaluate at
// conversation time so the same lord always says the same line.
