// ASH AND EMBER — AI/NpcCastPlanner.cs
//
// Pure decision math for how an NPC mage lord SPENDS his magic — no TaleWorlds
// types, fully testable (PureLogicTests).
//
// A lord pays LIFE EXPECTANCY to cast (like the player): every working lowers the
// age at which the inner fire finally burns him out. His remaining life is a real,
// finite RESOURCE. A person spends a resource differently depending on how much of
// it is left and on temperament:
//   • plenty of life  → cast big and often
//   • near burnout    → hoard the years: weaker workings, cast rarely, and only
//                        pour out full power when survival is on the line
//   • Impulsive lords spend recklessly regardless; Calculating lords are misers.
//
// The Ashen pay nothing (the cold preserves what remains) and never route through
// this planner — the caller skips it for them.
