// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — AI/TempleDialogue.cs
// Replaces vanilla lord dialogue for all Templar lords (The Holy Temple /
// vlandia kingdom) with religiously grounded lines befitting warrior-monks
// of the Order. Mirrors the structure of AshenDialogue.cs.
//
// Each lord speaks from a pool of lines selected deterministically by their
// StringId hash. Multiple variants are registered; conditions evaluate at
// conversation time so the same lord always says the same line.
