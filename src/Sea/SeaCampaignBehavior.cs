// ASH AND EMBER — Sea/SeaCampaignBehavior.cs
//
// Sea travel, sea trade, and abstracted sea battles.
//
// Harbors: a curated set of coastal towns gains a "Visit the harbor" entry in
// the town menu. From the harbor the player can:
//   • Charter passage — pay a distance-scaled fare, then wait out the crossing
//     in a wait-menu voyage. Mid-voyage hazards roll once each: a storm (lost
//     hours, wounded men) and corsairs (an abstracted boarding battle resolved
//     by SeaMath, with fight / spell / tribute / flee choices).
//   • Fund a trade venture — invest denars on a route; the cog returns after
//     SeaMath.VentureDays and pays out (or is lost to the sea) on daily tick.
//   • Call the Emberwind (mages) — spend aging days to halve the next crossing
//     and ward it against storms.
//
// All numerical resolution lives in SeaMath.cs (pure, tested). This file only
// gathers inputs from the campaign, applies outcomes, and drives the menus.
// Ports are matched by town name so a wrong entry degrades to "no harbor"
// rather than a crash; localized town names simply disable the system.
