// ASH AND EMBER — Schemes/SchemeMinigame.cs
// Push-your-luck operation minigame for player scheme resolution.
// NPC schemes use the original RNG path — this file does not affect them.
//
// The Gambit is optional. Before it begins, the player may instead Trust to
// Instinct: one Roguery gamble (same 20–80% curve as Sidestep) decides success
// or failure outright — no rounds, no field reports, no bonus. Playing the
// full Gambit and extracting above the bare threshold earns a potency bonus
// (up to 1.5×, scaling success magnitude, skill XP, and post-op cooldown)
// that a skipped operation never reaches — see ComputePotency/ResolveSkip.
//
// Each phase: a field report arrives. The operative decides HOW to push:
//   · PUSH HARD (Aggressive): hidden roll +4 to +10 — volatile, high reward
//   · TREAD CAREFULLY:        hidden roll −3 to +3  — balanced, unpredictable
//   · PULL BACK (Defensive):  hidden roll −4 to −10 — always reduces exposure
// Or: EXTRACT to stand down, SIDESTEP (Roguery) to skip, TALK IT DOWN (Charm).
//
// Rounds are limited — count scales with Roguery (5–10). When rounds run out:
//   50% → Bust (blown), 50% → Fail (quiet retreat, no consequences).
//
// The exact roll is always hidden until after the choice is made.
// Blown if exposure > 21. Success if extraction at or above the threshold.
//
//   Roguery 0   → 5 rounds, Sidestep ~20%
//   Roguery 300 → 8 rounds, Sidestep ~56%
//   Roguery 500 → 10 rounds (cap), Sidestep ~80%
//   Charm drives Talk It Down on the same 20–80% curve.
