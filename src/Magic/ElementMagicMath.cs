// Pure numeric core of the unified elemental magic that merges the old fire and
// nature systems. No TaleWorlds types — fully testable (PureLogicTests).
//
// One inner fire, five elements. Fire is the physical-and-spiritual root and is
// always available; Wind / Earth / Water / Spirit are learned. Each element has
// an ATTACK (cone/blast) and a WALL.
//
// Casting: hold focus, stand still, and DRAW a charge. The length of the draw
// sets the working's POWER, not its price — an instant release is weak, and the
// power climbs to full at a 10 s cap (drawing longer gains nothing). Hold a full
// 10 s without releasing and the gathered energy DISPERSES — you must draw again.
// The aging cost is FLAT: the same however long you drew. The Nature discipline
// makes that flat cost cheaper (the patient, land-tuned draw spends fewer years).
// Aging "burns through" exactly like the old fire magic.
