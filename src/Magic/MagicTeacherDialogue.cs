// The attuned — those the land speaks through (Nature Seers) — each carry ONE
// craft of the inner fire beyond their own. When a mage who already carries the
// fire speaks with one, they may be taught that craft for one focus point less
// than the lonely road would cost (see MagicLearning.NextCost(fromTeacher:true)).
//
// Which craft a given teacher carries is fixed by who they are — a stable hash
// of their identity — so the same lord always teaches the same power.
