// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — Magic/ElementSpellMinigame.cs
//
// The memory-rite for the unified element map workings, mirroring the old
// SpellMinigame. A three-step rite is shown, then each step must be recalled
// from three options; the score scales the working's power:
//
//   3/3 → 1.50×  Resonance — the rite was perfect.
//   2/3 → 1.20×  The working takes hold.
//   1/3 → 0.80×  The words blur.
//   0/3 → 0.50×  The words scatter.
//
// "Cast without the rite" skips straight to a 1.00× cast. The daily aging toll
// is shared with the fire workings via TalentSystem (RegisterMapCast / cost), so
// the escalating cost cannot be sidestepped by mixing systems. The Ashen pay in
// criminal standing and risk possession, exactly as before.
