// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — Soldier/SoldierServiceCampaignBehavior.cs
// "Take the Lord's Coin" — hire your own party out to a warring commander as a
// common soldier. Unlike a mercenary contract (clan tier 1+), a sworn sword can
// take service from clan level 0.
//
// While in service the player marches *in the commander's host* — a real member
// of his army, moved by the army leader and pulled into his battles on his side,
// earning renown/XP/loot like any lord who answered a gathering call. If the
// commander leads no host of his own, one is raised under his banner for the term
// (and dissolved when it ends). The player is treated as a mercenary of his realm
// and is paid every week (party upkeep + a small bounty). Abandoning the host (the
// vanilla "Abandon Army" button) before the agreed term is desertion (crime +
// relation loss), and the player is warned first. Serving the full term pays a
// parting bonus and releases you cleanly, like a mercenary contract, with no
// lasting allegiance.
//
// Dialogue lives in the .Dialogue.cs partial; the tick/army/pay logic is here.
