// =============================================================================
// ASH AND EMBER — AmbientRemarks.cs
// Two non-intrusive ambient systems:
//
//   Campfire Vignettes — a single-line observation fires on daily tick when
//   the player is outside a settlement (~7% chance, 8-day cooldown — a rare
//   aside, not a habit). Pools: general travel, mage-specific, aged,
//   cold-touched (high whisper tier), plus situational pools (wounded
//   column, war, each season, riding alone vs. a large host) that can
//   pre-empt the flat pools when the world state actually warrants it.
//
//   Companion Remarks — a companion makes an unprompted world-aware comment
//   on settlement entry (~12% chance, 6-day cooldown — deliberately rare, so
//   a line lands as a moment rather than chatter). Every trait pool the
//   companion currently qualifies for (Valor/Mercy/Calculating/Honor/
//   Generosity/cynical), plus a standout skill and a standout attribute if
//   either clears a threshold, are collected as candidates and one is picked
//   at random — so a companion who is both Valorous and Merciful doesn't
//   always speak as the soldier, and a companion's Medicine or Cunning shows
//   through even when their traits are middling. The last ~10 lines heard are
//   remembered and a fresh remark is re-rolled (up to 5 tries) if it would
//   repeat one; the same companion also won't speak twice in a row while
//   another is available. Trait pools carry world-state branches AND five
//   relation tiers; skill/attribute pools use a coarser three-tone version
//   of the same scale:
//
//     Very negative  (≤ −50)  — hostile, pointed, implies distrust     ┐
//     Negative       (−49 to −10) — clipped, professional, cool        ├ Cool
//     Neutral        (−9 to +9)   — matter-of-fact, observational      — Neutral
//     Positive       (+10 to +49) — warm, collegial, "we" framing      ┐
//     Very positive  (≥ +50)  — personal, familiar, protective         ├ Warm
//
// Both systems are purely cosmetic — no mechanics, no save keys needed.
